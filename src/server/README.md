backend built with flask

to initialize flask in your python code editor run the following commands:  
The following command installs virtualenv

`pip install virtualenv`  

This command needs administrator privileges. Add sudo before pip on Linux/Mac OS. If you are on Windows, log in as Administrator. On Ubuntu virtualenv may be installed using its package manager.

`Sudo apt-get install virtualenv`  

Once installed, new virtual environment is created in a folder.   

```
mkdir newproj
cd newproj
virtualenv venv
```  

To activate corresponding environment, on Linux/OS X, use the following âˆ’   

`source venv/bin/activate`  

On Windows, following can be used  

`venv\scripts\activate`  

We are now ready to install Flask in this environment.  

`pip install Flask`   

finally run the following code to access the requests library in python:  
`pip install requests`   

and you should be ready to run the server! :)
